                        <h4>Human Factors in an Interactive Machine Learning System</h4>
                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning relies on data. Interactive machine learning
                            (IML) is a promising paradigm that combines machine learning algorithms with human
                            intelligence to create a more efficient learning process. In these systems, considering both
                            the algorithm and the human factors involved is essential to creating an effective system.
                            While there has been extensive research on the algorithmic factors of IML systems, there has
                            been less effort in studying human factors in IML system development. In particular,
                            cognitive load is essential when designing systems humans interact with because high
                            cognitive load impacts the user experience and can lead to decreased performance. The focus
                            of this study is to determine the effect of collaboration and system
                            controllability on participant cognitive load and model performance in an IML labeling
                            system. This study uses an IML system that links a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to a
                            named entity recognition (NER) labeling interface. The study is still ongoing but
                            preliminary analysis indicates that pair-based collaboration may not impact cognitive load
                            or model performance. Conversely, the controllability of the system may impact cognitive
                            load, but not model performance.</p>
